FunnyGUI:
=========


Description:
------------
FunnyGUI is a widget toolkit for pygame.
Ease of use has been the main target of this project.
See section Usage for more good news.


Usage:
------

The good news is that:
Every widget class in this library 
is derived from class pygame.sprite.Sprite
and should be used the same way.
I.e. create it using it's constructor 
e.g. widget=FunnyGui.button.Button("OK") 
then position it with 
e.g. widget.rect.move_ip(100,100) 
then draw it with 
e.g. widget.draw(screen) 
then wait for user event and when one occurs then update it with 
e.g. widget.update(event) 
and then redraw it with 
e.g. widget.draw(screen) 
and so on.
This is good news because this is the correct way 
to handle a graphic component. 
Updating widget with event is here separated 
from drawing widget.

See and run example.py for example of usage.

Code of this library is small and simple so you can try to read it.

FunnyGUI is a normal Python package and should be used this way.

Modul Pygame is required to be installed.
